@c The edition number appears in more than one place in this file
@c I don't really know what it means...
@c For example, it has said "Sixteenth" since sometime in the Emacs 22
@c series, all through 23, and into 24.  So it is not very useful IMO,
@c and offers nothing that EMACSVER does not.  I guess it relates
@c mainly to the published book sold by the FSF.  Hence no longer
@c bother including it except iftex.  Really, I think it should not be
@c here at all (since anyone can make a pdf version), but should just
@c be something added by the FSF during the publishing process.
@c Also, the lispref uses a float (3.0), whereas this uses an ordinal,
@c so the format is not even consistent.

本書では、Emacsエディタの使い方と簡単なカスタマイズについて解説します。読
者がプログラマであるとは想定していません。簡単なカスタマイズには、プログ

起動して@kbd{C-h t}と打ちます。こうすると、コマンドの説明、試し方とその実
行結果がどうなるかを記述した専用のファイルをとおしてEmacsを使いながら
Emacsを学べます。

初めて読む場合には、まず、1章と2章をざっと読んでください。
本書で用いる表記法とEmacs画面の一般的な体裁を説明します。
これらの章のどこで何が説明されているか心に留めて、
あとで参照できるようにしてください。
4章を読み終えたら、それまでのコマンドを練習してください。
そのあとの何章かでは、常用する基本的な技法や概念を説明します。
必要ならば試してみて、それらを完全に理解しておいてください。

14章から19章では、どんな編集作業にも有用な中級の機能を説明します。
20章以降に説明してある機能は、使う場合もあれば、使わない場合もあるでしょう。
必要になったときにそれぞれの章を読んでください。

Emacsが正常に動いてないように思えたら、障害対策の章を読んでください。よく
ある問題にどう対処するか説明し（@pxref{Lossage}）、Emacsのバグをいつどの

GNU Emacsは@dfn{フリーソフトウェア}です。
誰でも自由に利用でき、条件付きで自由に再配布できることを意味します。
GNU Emacsはパブリックドメイン（public domain）ではありません。
著作権が設定してあり、その配布には制限が課せられています。
しかし、これらの制限は、善良な協調的な市民が行うであろうことを
すべて許すように意図したものです。
許されないのは、
配布先に対して任意のバージョンのGNU Emacsの再配布を禁止する行為です。

@node Intro
@unnumbered Introduction

あなたは、先進的で、セルフドキュメント方式で、カスタマイズ可能で、
拡張可能な、GNU版の権化であるリアルタイム画面エディタ
Emacsについて読んでいるところです。
（「@acronym{GNU, @acronym{GNU}'s Not Unix}」の「@samp{G}」は発音します。）

Emacsは先進的（@dfn{advanced}）であるというのは、単純な挿入と削除だけでなく、
プロセスの制御、プログラムの字下げの自動化、
複数のファイルを同時に眺める、整形済みテキストを編集する、
文字、単語、行、文、段落、ページを扱うのと同様に、
異なるプログラミム言語の式やコメントを扱うといった機能も提供するからです。

@dfn{セルフドキュメント方式}とは、
特別な文字@kbd{Control-h}を打てば、
何ができるかいつでも知ることができるということです。
それによって、任意のコマンドが何をするものなのか調べたり、
ある話題に関連するすべてのコマンドを調べることができます。
@xref{Help}。

@dfn{カスタマイズ可能}とは、
Emacsコマンドの定義を若干変更できるということです。
たとえば、@samp{<**}で始まり@samp{**>}で終わるようなコメントの
プログラム言語を使っている場合には、
Emacsのコメント操作コマンドにこれらの文字列を使うように指示できます
（@pxref{Comments}）。
別の種類のカスタマイズとしては、コマンドセットの再編成があげられます。
たとえば、キーボード上で菱形を形作る位置にあるキーを
（上下左右の）4つの基本的なカーソル移動コマンドとして使いたければ、
そのようにキーを再定義できます。
@xref{Customization}。

@dfn{拡張可能}とは、単純なカスタマイズではなく、
Emacs自身のLisp処理系で動作するLisp言語でプログラムを書ける、
つまり、まったく新しいコマンドを書けるということです。
Emacsは『オンラインで拡張可能』なシステムです。
つまり、Emacsは互いに呼び合う数多くの関数に分割でき、
編集している最中でさえ、それらの関数のどれでも再定義できます。
Emacs全体を1つ1つコピーしたりせずに、
Emacsの任意の部分だけを置き換えることが可能です。
Emacsのほとんどの編集コマンドはLispで書いてあります。
少数の例外もLispで書くことも可能ですが、効率のためにCで書いてあります。
拡張機能を書けるのはプログラマだけですが、
書き上げてしまえば誰でもそれを利用できます。
