@section Introduction

Most graphical user interface toolkits provide a number of standard
user interface controls (sometimes known as `widgets' or `gadgets').
Emacs doesn't really support anything like this, except for an
incredibly powerful text ``widget.''  On the other hand, Emacs does
provide the necessary primitives to implement many other widgets
within a text buffer.  The @code{widget} package simplifies this task.

@cindex basic widgets
@cindex widgets, basic types
The basic widgets are:

@table @code
@item link
Areas of text with an associated action.  Intended for hypertext links
embedded in text.
@item push-button
Like link, but intended for stand-alone buttons.
@item editable-field
An editable text field.  It can be either variable or fixed length.
@item menu-choice
Allows the user to choose one of multiple options from a menu, each
option is itself a widget.  Only the selected option will be visible in
the buffer.
@item radio-button-choice
Allows the user to choose one of multiple options by activating radio
buttons.  The options are implemented as widgets.  All options will be
visible in the buffer.
@item item
A simple constant widget intended to be used in the @code{menu-choice} and
@code{radio-button-choice} widgets.
@item choice-item
A button item only intended for use in choices.  When invoked, the user
will be asked to select another option from the choice widget.
@item toggle
A simple @samp{on}/@samp{off} switch.
@item checkbox
A checkbox (@samp{[ ]}/@samp{[X]}).
@item editable-list
Create an editable list.  The user can insert or delete items in the
list.  Each list item is itself a widget.
@end table

Now, of what possible use can support for widgets be in a text editor?
I'm glad you asked.  The answer is that widgets are useful for
implementing forms.  A @dfn{form} in Emacs is a buffer where the user is
supposed to fill out a number of fields, each of which has a specific
meaning.  The user is not supposed to change or delete any of the text
between the fields.  Examples of forms in Emacs are the @file{forms}
package (of course), the customize buffers, the mail and news compose
modes, and the @acronym{HTML} form support in the @file{w3} browser.

@cindex widget library, why use it
The advantages for a programmer of using the @code{widget} package to
implement forms are:

@enumerate
@item
More complex fields than just editable text are supported.
@item
You can give the users immediate feedback if they enter invalid data in a
text field, and sometimes prevent entering invalid data.
@item
You can have fixed sized fields, thus allowing multiple fields to be
lined up in columns.
@item
It is simple to query or set the value of a field.
@item
Editing happens in the buffer, not in the mini-buffer.
@item
Packages using the library get a uniform look, making them easier for
the user to learn.
@item
As support for embedded graphics improve, the widget library will be
extended to use the GUI features.  This means that your code using the
widget library will also use the new graphic features automatically.
@end enumerate

In order to minimize the code that is loaded by users who does not
create any widgets, the code has been split in two files:

@cindex widget library, files
@table @file
@item widget.el
This will declare the user variables, define the function
@code{define-widget}, and autoload the function @code{widget-create}.
@item wid-edit.el
Everything else is here, there is no reason to load it explicitly, as
it will be autoloaded when needed.
@end table

@node User Interface, Programming Example, Introduction, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section User Interface

A form consist of read only text for documentation and some fields,
where each field contains two parts, a tag and a value.  The tags are
used to identify the fields, so the documentation can refer to the
@samp{foo field}, meaning the field tagged with @samp{Foo}. Here is an
example form:

@example
Here is some documentation.

Name: @i{My Name}     @strong{Choose}: This option
Address:  @i{Some Place
In some City
Some country.}

See also @b{_other work_} for more information.

Numbers: count to three below
@b{[INS]} @b{[DEL]} @i{One}
@b{[INS]} @b{[DEL]} @i{Eh, two?}
@b{[INS]} @b{[DEL]} @i{Five!}
@b{[INS]}

Select multiple:

@b{[X]} This
@b{[ ]} That
@b{[X]} Thus

Select one:

@b{(*)} One
@b{( )} Another One.
@b{( )} A Final One.

@b{[Apply Form]} @b{[Reset Form]}
@end example

The top level widgets in is example are tagged @samp{Name},
@samp{Choose}, @samp{Address}, @samp{_other work_}, @samp{Numbers},
@samp{Select multiple}, @samp{Select one}, @samp{[Apply Form]}, and
@samp{[Reset Form]}.  There are basically two things the user can do
within a form, namely editing the editable text fields and activating
the buttons.

@subsection Editable Text Fields

In the example, the value for the @samp{Name} is most likely displayed
in an editable text field, and so are values for each of the members of
the @samp{Numbers} list.  All the normal Emacs editing operations are
available for editing these fields.  The only restriction is that each
change you make must be contained within a single editable text field.
For example, capitalizing all text from the middle of one field to the
middle of another field is prohibited.

Editable text fields are created by the @code{editable-field} widget.

An editable field must be surrounded by static text on both sides, that
is, text that does not change in the lifetime of the widget.  If the
field extends to the end of the line, the terminating line-feed character
will count as the necessary static text on that end, but you will have
to provide the static text before the field yourself.  The
@code{:format} keyword is useful for generating the static text; for
instance, if you give it a value of @code{"Name: %v"}, the "Name: " part
will count as the static text.

The editing text fields are highlighted with the
@code{widget-field-face} face, making them easy to find.

@deffn Face widget-field-face
Face used for other editing fields.
@end deffn

@subsection Buttons

@cindex widget buttons
@cindex button widgets
Some portions of the buffer have an associated @dfn{action}, which can
be @dfn{invoked} by a standard key or mouse command.  These portions
are called @dfn{buttons}.  The default commands for activating a button
are:

@table @kbd
@item @key{RET}
@deffn Command widget-button-press @var{pos} &optional @var{event}
Invoke the button at @var{pos}, defaulting to point.
If point is not located on a button, invoke the binding in
@code{widget-global-map} (by default the global map).
@end deffn

@kindex Mouse-2 @r{(on button widgets})
@item Mouse-2
@deffn Command widget-button-click @var{event}
Invoke the button at the location of the mouse pointer.  If the mouse
pointer is located in an editable text field, invoke the binding in
@code{widget-global-map} (by default the global map).
@end deffn
@end table

There are several different kind of buttons, all of which are present in
the example:

@table @emph
@cindex option field tag
@item The Option Field Tags
When you invoke one of these buttons, you will be asked to choose
between a number of different options.  This is how you edit an option
field.  Option fields are created by the @code{menu-choice} widget.  In
the example, @samp{@b{Choose}} is an option field tag.
@item The @samp{@b{[INS]}} and @samp{@b{[DEL]}} buttons
Activating these will insert or delete elements from an editable list.
The list is created by the @code{editable-list} widget.
@cindex embedded buttons
@item Embedded Buttons
The @samp{@b{_other work_}} is an example of an embedded
button.  Embedded buttons are not associated with a fields, but can serve
any purpose, such as implementing hypertext references.  They are
usually created by the @code{link} widget.
@item The @samp{@b{[ ]}} and @samp{@b{[X]}} buttons
Activating one of these will convert it to the other.  This is useful
for implementing multiple-choice fields.  You can create it with the
@code{checkbox} widget.
@item The @samp{@b{( )}} and @samp{@b{(*)}} buttons
Only one radio button in a @code{radio-button-choice} widget can be
selected at any time.  When you invoke one of the unselected radio
buttons, it will be selected and the previous selected radio button will
become unselected.
@item The @samp{@b{[Apply Form]}} @samp{@b{[Reset Form]}} buttons
These are explicit buttons made with the @code{push-button} widget.  The
main difference from the @code{link} widget is that the buttons will be
displayed as GUI buttons when possible.
@end table

To make them easier to locate, buttons are emphasized in the buffer.

@deffn Face widget-button-face
Face used for buttons.
@end deffn

@defopt widget-mouse-face
Face used for highlighting a button when the mouse pointer moves across
it.
@end defopt

@subsection Navigation

You can use all the normal Emacs commands to move around in a form
buffer, plus you will have these additional commands:

@table @kbd
@item @key{TAB}
@deffn Command widget-forward &optional count
Move point @var{count} buttons or editing fields forward.
@end deffn
@item @key{M-TAB}
@deffn Command widget-backward &optional count
Move point @var{count} buttons or editing fields backward.
@end deffn
@end table

@node Setting Up the Buffer, Basic Types, Programming Example, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Setting Up the Buffer

Widgets are created with @code{widget-create}, which returns a
@dfn{widget} object.  This object can be queried and manipulated by
other widget functions, until it is deleted with @code{widget-delete}.
After the widgets have been created, @code{widget-setup} must be called
to enable them.

@defun widget-create type [ keyword argument ]@dots{}
Create and return a widget of type @var{type}.
The syntax for the @var{type} argument is described in @ref{Basic Types}.

The keyword arguments can be used to overwrite the keyword arguments
that are part of @var{type}.
@end defun

@defun widget-delete widget
Delete @var{widget} and remove it from the buffer.
@end defun

@defun widget-setup
Set up a buffer to support widgets.

This should be called after creating all the widgets and before allowing
the user to edit them.
@refill
@end defun

If you want to insert text outside the widgets in the form, the
recommended way to do that is with @code{widget-insert}.

@defun widget-insert
Insert the arguments, either strings or characters, at point.
The inserted text will be read-only.
@end defun

There is a standard widget keymap which you might find useful.

@findex widget-button-press
@findex widget-button-click
@defvr Const widget-keymap
A keymap with the global keymap as its parent.@*
@key{TAB} and @kbd{C-@key{TAB}} are bound to @code{widget-forward} and
@code{widget-backward}, respectively.  @key{RET} and @kbd{Mouse-2}
are bound to @code{widget-button-press} and
@code{widget-button-click}.@refill
@end defvr

@defvar widget-global-map
Keymap used by @code{widget-button-press} and @code{widget-button-click}
when not on a button.  By default this is @code{global-map}.
@end defvar

@node Basic Types, Sexp Types, Setting Up the Buffer, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Basic Types

The syntax of a type specification is given below:

@example
NAME ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]... ARGS)
     |   NAME
@end example

Where, @var{name} is a widget name, @var{keyword} is the name of a
property, @var{argument} is the value of the property, and @var{args}
are interpreted in a widget specific way.

@cindex keyword arguments
The following keyword arguments that apply to all widgets:

@table @code
@vindex value@r{ keyword}
@item :value
The initial value for widgets of this type.

@vindex format@r{ keyword}
@item :format
This string will be inserted in the buffer when you create a widget.
The following @samp{%} escapes are available:

@table @samp
@item %[
@itemx %]
The text inside will be marked as a button.

By default, the text will be shown in @code{widget-button-face}, and
surrounded by brackets.

@defopt widget-button-prefix
String to prefix buttons.
@end defopt

@defopt widget-button-suffix
String to suffix buttons.
@end defopt

@item %@{
@itemx %@}
The text inside will be displayed with the face specified by
@code{:sample-face}.

@item %v
This will be replaced with the buffer representation of the widget's
value.  What this is depends on the widget type.

@item %d
Insert the string specified by @code{:doc} here.

@item %h
Like @samp{%d}, with the following modifications: If the documentation
string is more than one line, it will add a button which will toggle
between showing only the first line, and showing the full text.
Furthermore, if there is no @code{:doc} property in the widget, it will
instead examine the @code{:documentation-property} property.  If it is a
lambda expression, it will be called with the widget's value as an
argument, and the result will be used as the documentation text.

@item %t
Insert the string specified by @code{:tag} here, or the @code{princ}
representation of the value if there is no tag.

@item %%
Insert a literal @samp{%}.
@end table

@vindex button-face@r{ keyword}
@item :button-face
Face used to highlight text inside %[ %] in the format.

@vindex button-prefix@r{ keyword}
@vindex button-suffix@r{ keyword}
@item :button-prefix
@itemx :button-suffix
Text around %[ %] in the format.

These can be
@table @emph
@item nil
No text is inserted.

@item a string
The string is inserted literally.

@item a symbol
The value of the symbol is expanded according to this table.
@end table

@vindex doc@r{ keyword}
@item :doc
The string inserted by the @samp{%d} escape in the format
string.

@vindex tag@r{ keyword}
@item :tag
The string inserted by the @samp{%t} escape in the format
string.

@vindex tag-glyph@r{ keyword}
@item :tag-glyph
Name of image to use instead of the string specified by @code{:tag} on
Emacsen that supports it.

@vindex help-echo@r{ keyword}
@item :help-echo
Specifies how to display a message whenever you move to the widget with
either @code{widget-forward} or @code{widget-backward} or move the mouse
over it (using the standard @code{help-echo} mechanism).  The argument
is either a string to display, a function of one argument, the widget,
which should return a string to display, or a form that evaluates to
such a string.

@vindex indent@r{ keyword}
@item :indent
An integer indicating the absolute number of spaces to indent children
of this widget.

@vindex offset@r{ keyword}
@item :offset
An integer indicating how many extra spaces to add to the widget's
grandchildren compared to this widget.

@vindex extra-offset@r{ keyword}
@item :extra-offset
An integer indicating how many extra spaces to add to the widget's
children compared to this widget.

@vindex notify@r{ keyword}
@item :notify
A function called each time the widget or a nested widget is changed.
The function is called with two or three arguments.  The first argument
is the widget itself, the second argument is the widget that was
changed, and the third argument is the event leading to the change, if
any.

@vindex menu-tag@r{ keyword}
@item :menu-tag
Tag used in the menu when the widget is used as an option in a
@code{menu-choice} widget.

@vindex menu-tag-get@r{ keyword}
@item :menu-tag-get
Function used for finding the tag when the widget is used as an option
in a @code{menu-choice} widget.  By default, the tag used will be either the
@code{:menu-tag} or @code{:tag} property if present, or the @code{princ}
representation of the @code{:value} property if not.

@vindex match@r{ keyword}
@item :match
Should be a function called with two arguments, the widget and a value,
and returning non-@code{nil} if the widget can represent the specified value.

@vindex validate@r{ keyword}
@item :validate
A function which takes a widget as an argument, and returns @code{nil}
if the widget's current value is valid for the widget.  Otherwise it
should return the widget containing the invalid data, and set that
widget's @code{:error} property to a string explaining the error.

The following predefined function can be used:

@defun widget-children-validate widget
All the @code{:children} of @var{widget} must be valid.
@end defun

@vindex tab-order@r{ keyword}
@item :tab-order
Specify the order in which widgets are traversed with
@code{widget-forward} or @code{widget-backward}.  This is only partially
implemented.

@enumerate a
@item
Widgets with tabbing order @code{-1} are ignored.

@item
(Unimplemented) When on a widget with tabbing order @var{n}, go to the
next widget in the buffer with tabbing order @var{n+1} or @code{nil},
whichever comes first.

@item
When on a widget with no tabbing order specified, go to the next widget
in the buffer with a positive tabbing order, or @code{nil}
@end enumerate

@vindex parent@r{ keyword}
@item :parent
The parent of a nested widget (e.g.@: a @code{menu-choice} item or an
element of a @code{editable-list} widget).

@vindex sibling-args@r{ keyword}
@item :sibling-args
This keyword is only used for members of a @code{radio-button-choice} or
@code{checklist}.  The value should be a list of extra keyword
arguments, which will be used when creating the @code{radio-button} or
@code{checkbox} associated with this item.

@end table

@deffn {User Option} widget-glyph-directory
Directory where glyphs are found.
Widget will look here for a file with the same name as specified for the

A number of widgets for editing @dfn{s-expressions} (lisp types), sexp
for short, are also available.  These basically fall in several
categories described in this section.

@menu
* constants::
* generic::
* atoms::
* composite::
@end menu

@node constants, generic, Sexp Types, Sexp Types
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection The Constant Widgets
@cindex constant widgets

The @code{const} widget can contain any lisp expression, but the user is
prohibited from editing it, which is mainly useful as a component of one
of the composite widgets.

The syntax for the @code{const} widget is:

@example
TYPE ::= (const [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])
@end example

The @var{value}, if present, is used to initialize the @code{:value}
property and can be any s-expression.

@deffn Widget const
This will display any valid s-expression in an immutable part of the
buffer.
@end deffn

There are two variations of the @code{const} widget, namely
@code{variable-item} and @code{function-item}.  These should contain a
symbol with a variable or function binding.  The major difference from
the @code{const} widget is that they will allow the user to see the
variable or function documentation for the symbol.

@deffn Widget variable-item
An immutable symbol that is bound as a variable.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget function-item
An immutable symbol that is bound as a function.
@end deffn

@node generic, atoms, constants, Sexp Types
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Generic Sexp Widget
@cindex generic sexp widget

The @code{sexp} widget can contain any lisp expression, and allows the
user to edit it inline in the buffer.

The syntax for the @code{sexp} widget is:

@example
TYPE ::= (sexp [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])
@end example

@deffn Widget sexp
This will allow you to edit any valid s-expression in an editable buffer
field.

The @code{sexp} widget takes the same keyword arguments as the
@code{editable-field} widget.  @xref{editable-field}.
@end deffn

@node atoms, composite, generic, Sexp Types
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Atomic Sexp Widgets
@cindex atomic sexp widget

The atoms are s-expressions that do not consist of other s-expressions.
For example, a string, a file name, or a symbol are atoms, while a list
is a composite type.  You can edit the value of an atom with the
following widgets.

The syntax for all the atoms are:

@example
TYPE ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  [ VALUE ])
@end example

The @var{value}, if present, is used to initialize the @code{:value}
property and must be an expression of the same type as the widget.
That is, the string widget can only be initialized with a string.

All the atom widgets take the same keyword arguments as the
@code{editable-field} widget.  @xref{editable-field}.

@deffn Widget string
Allows you to edit a string in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget regexp
Allows you to edit a regular expression in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget character
Allows you to enter a character in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget file
Allows you to edit a file name in an editable field.  If you invoke
the tag button, you can edit the file name in the mini-buffer with
completion.

Keywords:
@table @code
@vindex must-match@r{ keyword}
@item :must-match
If this is set to non-nil, only existing file names will be allowed in
the minibuffer.
@end table
@end deffn

@deffn Widget directory
Allows you to edit a directory name in an editable field.
Similar to the @code{file} widget.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget symbol
Allows you to edit a lisp symbol in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget function
Allows you to edit a lambda expression, or a function name with completion.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget variable
Allows you to edit a variable name, with completion.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget integer
Allows you to edit an integer in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget number
Allows you to edit a number in an editable field.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget boolean
Allows you to edit a boolean.  In lisp this means a variable which is
either nil meaning false, or non-nil meaning true.
@end deffn


@node composite,  , atoms, Sexp Types
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@subsection Composite Sexp Widgets
@cindex composite sexp widgets

The syntax for the composite widget is:

@example
TYPE ::= (NAME [KEYWORD ARGUMENT]...  COMPONENT...)
@end example

@noindent
where each @var{component} must be a widget type.  Each component widget
will be displayed in the buffer, and will be editable by the user.

@deffn Widget cons
The value of a @code{cons} widget is a cons-cell where the @code{car} is
the value of the first component and the @code{cdr} is the value of the
second component.  There must be exactly two components.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget list
The value of a @code{list} widget is a list containing the value of
each of its component.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget vector
The value of a @code{vector} widget is a vector containing the value of
each of its component.
@end deffn

The above suffice for specifying fixed size lists and vectors.  To get
variable length lists and vectors, you can use a @code{choice},
@code{set}, or @code{repeat} widgets together with the @code{:inline}
keywords.  If any component of a composite widget has the @code{:inline}
keyword set, its value must be a list which will then be spliced into
the composite.  For example, to specify a list whose first element must
be a file name, and whose remaining arguments should either by the
symbol @code{t} or two files, you can use the following widget
specification:

@example
(list file
      (choice (const t)
              (list :inline t
                    :value ("foo" "bar")
                    string string)))
@end example

The value of a widget of this type will either have the form
@code{(file t)} or @code{(file string string)}.

This concept of inline is probably hard to understand.  It was certainly
hard to implement, so instead of confusing you more by trying to explain
it here, I'll just suggest you meditate over it for a while.

@deffn Widget choice
Allows you to edit a sexp which may have one of a fixed set of types.
It is currently implemented with the @code{choice-menu} basic widget,
and has a similar syntax.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget set
Allows you to specify a type which must be a list whose elements all
belong to given set.  The elements of the list are not significant.
This is implemented on top of the @code{checklist} basic widget, and has
a similar syntax.
@end deffn

@deffn Widget repeat
Allows you to specify a variable length list whose members are all of
the same type.  Implemented on top of the @code{editable-list} basic
widget, and has a similar syntax.
@end deffn

@node Widget Properties, Defining New Widgets, Sexp Types, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Properties
@cindex properties of widgets
@cindex widget properties

You can examine or set the value of a widget by using the widget object
that was returned by @code{widget-create}.

@defun widget-value widget
Return the current value contained in @var{widget}.
It is an error to call this function on an uninitialized widget.
@end defun

@defun widget-value-set widget value
Set the value contained in @var{widget} to @var{value}.
It is an error to call this function with an invalid @var{value}.
@end defun

@strong{Important:} You @emph{must} call @code{widget-setup} after
modifying the value of a widget before the user is allowed to edit the
widget again.  It is enough to call @code{widget-setup} once if you
modify multiple widgets.  This is currently only necessary if the widget
contains an editing field, but may be necessary for other widgets in the
future.

If your application needs to associate some information with the widget
objects, for example a reference to the item being edited, it can be
done with @code{widget-put} and @code{widget-get}.  The property names
must begin with a @samp{:}.

@defun widget-put widget property value
In @var{widget} set @var{property} to @var{value}.
@var{property} should be a symbol, while @var{value} can be anything.
@end defun

@defun widget-get widget property
In @var{widget} return the value for @var{property}.
@var{property} should be a symbol, the value is what was last set by
@code{widget-put} for @var{property}.
@end defun

@defun widget-member widget property
Non-nil if @var{widget} has a value (even nil) for property @var{property}.
@end defun

Occasionally it can be useful to know which kind of widget you have,
i.e.@: the name of the widget type you gave when the widget was created.

@defun widget-type widget
Return the name of @var{widget}, a symbol.
@end defun

@cindex active widget
@cindex inactive widget
@cindex activate a widget
@cindex deactivate a widget
Widgets can be in two states: active, which means they are modifiable by
the user, or inactive, which means they cannot be modified by the user.
You can query or set the state with the following code:

@lisp
;; Examine if @var{widget} is active or not.
(if (widget-apply @var{widget} :active)
    (message "Widget is active.")
  (message "Widget is inactive.")

;; Make @var{widget} inactive.
(widget-apply @var{widget} :deactivate)

;; Make @var{widget} active.
(widget-apply @var{widget} :activate)
@end lisp

A widget is inactive if it, or any of its ancestors (found by
following the @code{:parent} link), have been deactivated.  To make sure
a widget is really active, you must therefore activate both it and
all its ancestors.

@lisp
(while widget
  (widget-apply widget :activate)
  (setq widget (widget-get widget :parent)))
@end lisp

You can check if a widget has been made inactive by examining the value
of the @code{:inactive} keyword.  If this is non-nil, the widget itself
has been deactivated.  This is different from using the @code{:active}
keyword, in that the latter tells you if the widget @strong{or} any of
its ancestors have been deactivated.  Do not attempt to set the
@code{:inactive} keyword directly.  Use the @code{:activate}
@code{:deactivate} keywords instead.


@node Defining New Widgets, Widget Browser, Widget Properties, Top
@comment  node-name,  next,  previous,  up
@section Defining New Widgets
@cindex new widgets
@cindex defining new widgets

You can define specialized widgets with @code{define-widget}.  It allows
you to create a shorthand for more complex widgets, including specifying
component widgets and new default values for the keyword
arguments.

@defun define-widget name class doc &rest args
Define a new widget type named @var{name} from @code{class}.

@var{name} and class should both be symbols, @code{class} should be one
of the existing widget types.

The third argument @var{DOC} is a documentation string for the widget.

After the new widget has been defined, the following two calls will
create identical widgets:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@lisp
(widget-create @var{name})
@end lisp

@item
@lisp
(apply widget-create @var{class} @var{args})
@end lisp
@end itemize

@end defun

Using @code{define-widget} just stores the definition of the widget type
in the @code{widget-type} property of @var{name}, which is what
@code{widget-create} uses.

If you only want to specify defaults for keywords with no complex
conversions, you can use @code{identity} as your conversion function.

The following additional keyword arguments are useful when defining new
widgets:
@table @code
@vindex convert-widget@r{ keyword}
@item :convert-widget
Function to convert a widget type before creating a widget of that
type.  It takes a widget type as an argument, and returns the converted
widget type.  When a widget is created, this function is called for the
widget type and all the widget's parent types, most derived first.

The following predefined functions can be used here:

@defun widget-types-convert-widget widget
Convert @code{:args} as widget types in @var{widget}.
@end defun

@defun widget-value-convert-widget widget
Initialize @code{:value} from @code{:args} in @var{widget}.
@end defun

@vindex copy@r{ keyword}
@item :copy
Function to deep copy a widget type.  It takes a shallow copy of the
widget type as an argument (made by @code{copy-sequence}), and returns a
deep copy.  The purpose of this is to avoid having different instances
of combined widgets share nested attributes.

The following predefined functions can be used here:

@defun widget-types-copy widget
Copy @code{:args} as widget types in @var{widget}.
@end defun

@vindex value-to-internal@r{ keyword}
@item :value-to-internal
Function to convert the value to the internal format.  The function
takes two arguments, a widget and an external value, and returns the
internal value.  The function is called on the present @code{:value}
when the widget is created, and on any value set later with
@code{widget-value-set}.

@vindex value-to-external@r{ keyword}
@item :value-to-external
Function to convert the value to the external format.  The function
takes two arguments, a widget and an internal value, and returns the
external value.  The function is called on the present @code{:value}
when the widget is created, and on any value set later with
@code{widget-value-set}.

@vindex create@r{ keyword}
@item :create
Function to create a widget from scratch.  The function takes one
argument, a widget type, and creates a widget of that type, inserts it
in the buffer, and returns a widget object.

@vindex delete@r{ keyword}
@item :delete
Function to delete a widget.  The function takes one argument, a widget,
and should remove all traces of the widget from the buffer.

The default value is:

@defun widget-default-delete widget
Remove @var{widget} from the buffer.
Delete all @code{:children} and @code{:buttons} in @var{widget}.
@end defun

In most cases you should not change this value, but instead use
@code{:value-delete} to make any additional cleanup.

@vindex value-create@r{ keyword}
@item :value-create
Function to expand the @samp{%v} escape in the format string.  It will
be called with the widget as its argument and should insert a
representation of the widget's value in the buffer.

Nested widgets should be listed in @code{:children} or @code{:buttons}
to make sure they are automatically deleted.

@vindex value-delete@r{ keyword}
@item :value-delete
Should remove the representation of the widget's value from the buffer.
It will be called with the widget as its argument.  It doesn't have to
remove the text, but it should release markers and delete nested widgets
if these are not listed in @code{:children} or @code{:buttons}.

@vindex value-get@r{ keyword}
@item :value-get
Function to extract the value of a widget, as it is displayed in the
buffer.

The following predefined function can be used here:

@defun widget-value-value-get widget
Return the @code{:value} property of @var{widget}.
@end defun

@vindex format-handler@r{ keyword}
@item :format-handler
Function to handle unknown @samp{%} escapes in the format string.  It
will be called with the widget and the character that follows the
@samp{%} as arguments.  You can set this to allow your widget to handle
non-standard escapes.

@findex widget-default-format-handler
You should end up calling @code{widget-default-format-handler} to handle
unknown escape sequences, which will handle the @samp{%h} and any future
escape sequences, as well as give an error for unknown escapes.

@vindex action@r{ keyword}
@item :action
Function to handle user initiated events.  By default, @code{:notify}
the parent.

The following predefined function can be used here:

@defun widget-parent-action widget &optional event
Tell @code{:parent} of @var{widget} to handle the @code{:action}.
Optional @var{event} is the event that triggered the action.
@end defun

@vindex prompt-value@r{ keyword}
@item :prompt-value
Function to prompt for a value in the minibuffer.  The function should
take four arguments, @var{widget}, @var{prompt}, @var{value}, and
@var{unbound} and should return a value for widget entered by the user.
@var{prompt} is the prompt to use.  @var{value} is the default value to
use, unless @var{unbound} is non-nil, in which case there is no default
value.  The function should read the value using the method most natural
for this widget, and does not have to check that it matches.
@end table

If you want to define a new widget from scratch, use the @code{default}
widget as its base.

@deffn Widget default
Widget used as a base for other widgets.

It provides most of the functionality that is referred to as ``by
default'' in this text.

@item
It should be possible to add or remove items from a list with @kbd{C-k}
and @kbd{C-o} (suggested by @sc{rms}).

@item
The @samp{[INS]} and @samp{[DEL]} buttons should be replaced by a single
dash (@samp{-}).  The dash should be a button that, when invoked, asks
whether you want to add or delete an item (@sc{rms} wanted to git rid of
the ugly buttons, the dash is my idea).

The @code{menu-choice} tag should be prettier, something like the abbreviated
menus in Open Look.
